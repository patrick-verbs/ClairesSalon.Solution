# "Claire's Salon"

#### _Database basics in .NET Core MVC_ | Patrick Lee

## Description

This project was made to demonstrate basic proficiency in working with MySQL databases in C# with the .NET Core MVC framework. The solution allows a business owner, "Claire," to add, view, edit, and delete both employees (hair stylists) and their respective lists of customers, in a many-clients-to-one-stylist relationship.

## Setup and Use

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 5 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)
- A text editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- A command line interface like Terminal or GitBash to set up and run the project
- MySQL 8.0.19, following [these instructions](https://web.archive.org/web/20210521163651/https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/getting-started-with-c/installing-and-configuring-mysql)
  - MacOS:
    - [MySQL Community Server 8.0.19](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484914)
    - [MySQL Workbench 8.0.19](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484391)
  - Windows:
  - [MySQL Server & Workbench 8.0.19](https://downloads.mysql.com/archives/get/p/25/file/mysql-installer-web-community-8.0.19.0.msi)
- A web browser to view and interact with the project

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `$ git clone https://github.com/patrick-verbs/ClairesSalon.Solution`
2. Navigate to the `ClairesSalon.Solution` directory on your computer
3. Open with your preferred text editor to view the code base
4. To setup the SQL database:
  - Create an `appsettings.json` file in the `ClairesSalon.Solution/HairSalon` directory
  - Copy the text box below and paste into the `appsettings.json` file, replacing `<password>` with your MySQL password:
  ```
  {
    "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=patrick_lee;uid=root;pwd=<password>;"
    }
  }
  ```
  - __Option 1: Recreate the database structure using MySQL terminal commands__
    - Open your terminal and run the command: `mysql -uroot -p<mysql_password>` (replace `<mysql_password>` with your MySQL password) and select the enter key to launch MySQL server
    - Type the following commands to setup the database:
      1. `CREATE DATABASE patrick_lee;` to make a new database
      2. `USE patrick_lee;` to connect to the new database
      3. `CREATE TABLE {Stylists (StylistId INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, NameFirst VARCHAR(255), NameLast VARCHAR(255), Specialty VARCHAR(255), Phone VARCHAR(255), Email VARCHAR(255))};` to create a `{Stylists}` table
      4. `CREATE TABLE {Clients (ClientId INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, StylistId INT NOT NULL, NameFirst VARCHAR(255), NameLast VARCHAR(255), Phone VARCHAR(255), Email VARCHAR(255))};` to create another new table, `{Clients}`
  - __Option 2: Import the database structure using MySQL Workbench__
    - Open MySQL Workbench
    - On the "Welcome" page, double-click the MySQL instance in the __MySQL Connections__ section. You may be prompted to enter a password; if so, this will be `epicodus` or your custom password, just as in the earlier step
    - Click on the __Adminstration__ tab
      1. Click on _Data Import/Restore_
      2. In the Data Import window that appears, select _Import from Self-Contained File_
      3. Navigate the file selection to your cloned project location and choose the `.sql` file at `ClairesSalon.Solution/patrick_lee.sql`
      4. At the __Default Target Schema__ option, choose _New..._ and name the schema `hair_salon`
      5. Click the _Start Import_ button at the bottom-right; if you can't find it, you may need to maximize your MySQL Workbench window

5. To serve the local web app:
  - Navigate to `ClairesSalon.Solution/HairSalon}` in your command line
  - Run the command `dotnet restore` to restore the dependencies that are listed in `HairSalon.csproj`
  - Run the command `dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore -v 5.0.0`
  - Run the command `dotnet add package Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql -v 5.0.0-alpha.2`
  - Run the command `dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Proxies -v 5.0.0`
  - Run the command `dotnet build` to build the project and its dependencies into a set of binaries
  - Finally, run the command `dotnet run` to run the project!
  - Note: `dotnet run` also restores and builds the project, so you can use this single command to start the console app
6. Visit the application via web browser at: `localhost:5000/`
